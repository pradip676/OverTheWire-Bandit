# OverTheWire Bandit Walkthroughs 🎮💻

Hey there fellow hacker-in-training 😄

This is my student-style, slightly chaotic, but very real journey through all **34 levels** of the *OverTheWire: Bandit* wargame. From typing `ls` like a boss in level 0 to breaking out of uppercase jail in level 32, this repo has it ALL.

## 🧨 What even is Bandit?
Bandit is like Linux boot camp — except instead of drill sergeants yelling, it’s a server silently mocking you when `cat` doesn’t work. 

It’s a wargame for beginners that teaches you Linux commands, shell scripting, file permissions, networking basics, and how to keep your cool when `Permission denied` makes you question life choices. 

> No downloads. No installs. Just SSH your way into glory.

## 🧠 What I Learned (a.k.a. how I didn’t rage quit)
From Level 0 to 33, here’s the kinda stuff I figured out (eventually):
- How to find secret passwords hidden in the dumbest places
- What crontabs are and how they can be used for evil (or Bandit levels)
- Why SUID binaries are like cheat codes if you know what you're doing
- How Git tags, branches, and commit logs can hide your next move
- That you can **literally escape** an UPPERCASE-ONLY shell with `$0` (yup)

There were tears. There were victories. There was `chmod +x`.

## 🧰 Tools I now wield with confidence:
- Bash, sh, and weirdly `vi`
- `scp` and `ssh` like I’m in a hacker movie
- Git (tags, branches, logs — all the good stuff)
- Escaping fake shells and finding passwords like it’s Easter

## 💡 Why YOU Should Do Bandit
If you:
- Get confused by Linux permissions
- Are curious about cybersecurity
- Want to break things but legally

Then Bandit is literally made for you. It’s fun. It’s free. And it lowkey makes you smarter with every level.

## 🎉 Highlights
- Accidentally brute-forced a 4-digit pin like a keyboard warrior 🧠
- Wrote my first shell script that got wiped by cron before I could admire it 💀
- Pushed to a Git repo from a server and got rewarded with a password (best trade ever)
- Escaped the most annoying uppercase shell with `$0` — felt like a Linux ninja

## 🏁 I DID IT — All 34 Levels. Zero skips. Infinite Googling.
Seriously. Start to finish. Level 0 to Level 33. Solved, documented, and screen-captured.

If future levels come out, best believe I’m diving back in.

## 📸 Screenshots
I dropped a few terminal action shots in `Screenshots/` for the vibes.

You can find gems like:
- My brute-force Python script going brrrrr 🔁
- Terminal screenshots from restricted shells
- Final messages and Git tags revealing passwords
